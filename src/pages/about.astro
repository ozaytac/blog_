                <p>As a physicist turned modeling and simulation engineer, I thrive at the intersection of theoretical science and practical engineering applications. My academic journey spans physics and an ongoing master‚Äôs degree in statistics, reflecting my commitment to understanding both the fundamental laws of nature and the mathematical frameworks that describe them.
                  Currently, I work as a modeling and simulation engineer, where I leverage my diverse programming knowledge to create robust simulations and analyze complex systems. This role allows me to combine my physics background with computational methods to solve real-world engineering challenges.</p>
